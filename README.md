# YouTube AI Summary Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that summarizes the Youtube comment section on Youtube videos using Google's Gemini Nano. Works for the most part although has some bugs here and there

# Known Bugs

- If loading a new video while the AI is summarizing the current one, the new video will have the old AI summary
- Using the forward and back buttons do not trigger the AI to re-summarize. Whatever summary was there will stay there for moving forward and back
- The output of the AI summary doesn't sound as natural as I would want it to be. It likes to say "The author..." alot
